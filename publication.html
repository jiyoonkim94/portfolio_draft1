                <div class="text2">Project Goal 
                    <p>Our research team tried to determine the accuracy of visual perception judgments under illusory conditions. Recent studies suggest that the accuracy of perceptual judgments can be influenced by the perceived illusory size of a stimulus, with judgments being more accurate for increased illusory size. This phenomenon seems consistent with recent neuroscientific findings that representations in early visual areas reflect the perceived (illusory) size of stimuli rather than the physical size. We further explored this idea with the moon illusion, in which the moon appears larger when it is close to the horizon and smaller when it is higher in the sky. Participants (n = 230 ) adjusted the orientation of an image of the moon on a smartphone to match the perceived orientation of the moon in the sky. </p>

                <div class="text2">METHODOLOGY
                    <p >The experiment was run in two locations that had good views of the Eastern (for moonrise) or Western (for moonset) horizon. A string attached to a plumb bob was fixed to the top floor so that it hung straight down over the floor below in the view of participants as they judged the orientation of the moon.
                        The string provided a consistent vertical orientation that served as a reference for identifying the relative orientation of the moon in the sky. Participants were asked to look at the moon in the sky (it is quite small in photographs, so an image is digitally added in Fig. 1a) and to note the orientation of the moon relative to the vertically hanging string. Participants directed their smartphone to a website that displayed an image of the moon in a similar phase as the moon in the sky, but with a randomly chosen orientation (see Fig. 1b).
                        Holding the phone in landscape mode, the participant’s task was to push the slider to rotate the moon image.</p>

                <div class="text2">MAIN FINDING
                    <p>Contrary to previous studies that investigated accuracy and size illusions, we found slightly lower perceptual judgment accuracy when the moon appeared large (close to the horizon) compared to when it appeared small (high in the sky).
                        For a given trial, a participant may submit a match that is clockwise or counterclockwise relative to the true moon orientation. We averaged each participant’s signed errors across trials since the mean value indicates the participant’s best estimate of the moon’s relative orientation.
                        Across participants, the average mean error was X = 1.18 degrees with a standard deviation of s = 5.88 . Since the moon moves continuously across the sky, its altitude also changed during the experiment, but this movement was quite slow. We computed the range of moon altitudes for each participant; and the average value across participants was 0.24 degrees (maximum value 1.3 degrees). Given the small changes in altitude, it seems appropriate to average the altitude values as a convenient summary of the altitude of the moon during a participant’s participation in the experiment. Thus, each participant produces a single altitude value and a corresponding average orientation error.</p>

                <div class="text2">CONCLUSION
                    <p>Our experimental results disagree with the hypothesis that the accuracy of matching the moon’s orientation is improved when the moon appears large. If perceived size affected performance in this way, the judgment error magnitude should have increased as the moon altitude increased (and the perceived moon size decreased). If anything, we found the opposite effect. While there are two mechanisms that might seem consistent with the observed negative relationship between error and altitude, we argue below that they are too small to account for our findings.
                        Contrary to the recent studies, larger perceived size did not correspond to better perceptual judgments of the moon’s orientation. If anything, our results suggest an opposite effect; performance was better for a small perceived moon.</p>
