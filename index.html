            <div>Hello, my name is Jiyoon Kim. I am a 1st-year master's in HCI/UX based at the University of Michigan.</div>
            <br><br>
            <div>With Psychology research experience seeking an internship with emphasis on UX Research. I am focusung primarily on UX Research. I am very passionate about finding human hidden needs' and applying them to the design of products.</div>
            <br><br>
            <div>UX design helps designers develop technical solutions that enhance the quality of human lives. Professor Francis' Human-Computer Interaction research motivated me to pursue the UX field. He designed a keyboard for paralyzed people to enable them to use it easily with a trigger switch. Based on his research, I realized that UX could significantly improve user ability, ease of use and usefulness of various products, thereby improving quality of human lives. I would like to use my skills in a similar way to help people.</div>
            <br><br>
            <div>I want to help people in need, and I believe that learning UX principles will help me fulfill my dream. For example, people with disability, may it be movement or other types of disability, may not be able to use as many products as people do. I want to provide useful products and services based on the skills and theories I learn for the disabled as well as the various people who need help. I want to analyze human behavior and what motivates them, find out what users need most, and then contribute to improve their quality of life.</div>
